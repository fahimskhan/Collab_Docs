# Collab_Docs

**Demo video:** https://vimeo.com/302388823

Desktop app featuring a collaborative text editor. Users can launch the app and register with a username and password. Registered users can log in using the credentials they used for registration. Once logged in users will be directed to the homepage that will list their personal docs as well as shared docs. They can create new docs, edit and save them. Docs can be shared using doc keys and collaborated on by all users who have access to the docs. Users can delete the docs they own which will remove the doc from all shared users' home page. They can also remove docs that has been shared with them but that will not delete the original doc on owner's homepage.

We have used **React** and **Redux** for frontend, **Node** for backend, **Express** and **Socket.io** for communication between frontend and backend, **Passport** for user authentication, **Electron** to package as desktop application, **MongoDB** through mongoose for data storage, **Babel** for converting ES6 to ES5 and **Draft.js** for rich text formatting.
